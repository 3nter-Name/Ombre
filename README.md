# Ombre
 
This is a 2d platformer in the making by artist Atrina Vermillion, musician Azuran, and Programmer Enter-Name for Piratesoftware's 15th Pirate Jam[insert link]. Following the themes of Shadow and Alchemy, we decided to make Ombre a game about shifting between the realms and crafting potions to get to the exit of the stages. Learn the different combos of ingredients and where they like to grow to think of new and intresting ways to complete the level. Every level is designed to be completed in the dark and light realms but should be fastest going between. 

Good Luck and Have Fun!!
